# Overloading Constructors

We saw in the Classes lesson that we can have two kinds of constructors:

those that do not have input parameters
those that do have them.
There will be times when we would like to have both options in a class. Luckily, we can use Overloading to achieve it!

When create a class we can have two different constructors and the compiler will know which one we want.
