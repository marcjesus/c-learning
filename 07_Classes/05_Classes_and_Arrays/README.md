User defined objects can be used just as any other object is used.

For example, we can use a user defined object in an array. It can be a little tricky, so let's practice using classes by doing one with arrays.

In this program we are using the Student class from a previous example, to create a course. We'll use an array to create the course, and each element of course will be an instance of Student.
